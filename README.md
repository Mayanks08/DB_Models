Welcome to My Database  models repo which i created while i am working on personal project and inertnship 

This repository contains the database model and schema documentation for the **[Your Project Name]** project, designed using **MongoDB**.
It outlines the structure, relationships, and purpose of each collection used in the system.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `models/` — Contains MongoDB model definitions (using Mongoose or native schema design).
- `README.md` — Project overview and model documentation.

## 🧱 Database Design Overview

The MongoDB schema includes the following primary collections:

- `users` — Stores user information such as name, email, roles, and authentication data.
- `products` — Contains product details including name, price, description, and category.
- `orders` — Represents customer orders with references to users and products.
- `categories` — Organizes products into hierarchical groups.
- [Add any other relevant collections here]

Each collection is designed with scalability and performance in mind, following best practices in MongoDB schema design (e.g., embedded documents vs. references, indexing, etc.).

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Database**: MongoDB
- **ODM (if used)**: Mongoose
- **Environment**: Node.js / Express (optional — if part of your backend stack)
